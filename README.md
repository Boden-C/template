This repository is meant to include all important community files for open source projects

## Further Steps

1. All files are purposefully made ambiguous, it is recommended you look through and fill in your personal information.
2. This `README file` contains the format for [shields.io](https://img.shields.io), use [readme.so](https://readme.so/editor) to generate the rest
3. The `.gitignore` contains some of the possible files to ignore, use [GitHub's gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) for your specific language
4. If you expect contribution, look into updating the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, and `SECURITY.md`
